# Alcoholic Website 🍸  

I have created this website with the help of the YouTube channel **[JavaScript Mastery](https://www.youtube.com/c/JavaScriptMastery)**.  
The project focuses on showcasing alcoholic drinks and cocktails with a modern and interactive design.  

## ✨ Features

- **Modern Animations:** Implemented using **GSAP** for smooth and engaging transitions.  
- **Rendering Fixes:** Solved compatibility issues between **Next.js server-side rendering** and **GSAP animations** by carefully managing component rendering.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Next.js**  
- **React**  
- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**  
- **Tailwind CSS** (if used, mention here)
